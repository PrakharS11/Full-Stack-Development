MERN Stack : As Web app development has taken itself to the next level, several technologies are being used together to produce web apps that have extravagant features. Unlike Native apps can be e.g iOS apps, Android apps, web apps have far greater reach because web apps can be accessed on both desktop and mobile devices. Most of the companies are now looking for full stack developers who are having the knowledge of front and technologies like MONGODB, EXPRESS, &amp; NODE JS and back end technologies like REACT and can create a fully functional web app by managing both the frontend and backend of the web application.
